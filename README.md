<h4> Current Drexel University Honors Student in Textile Engineering and Technology. Passionate about using technology and nature driven solutions to revolutionize fashion and make it a more sustainable industry.Specialized in technology and biology integrated textile design. </h4>

<h2>About: </h2>
<p1> Drexel University’s Custom Designed Major allows students to create an interdisciplinary plan of study tailored to a specific focus. These focuses are centered around concentrations, specified by the majors students pursue. With the focus of my major being Textile Engineering and Technology, the areas of my concentrations are: Materials Science and Engineering, Textile Design, and User Experience/User Interface. I plan to graduate using technology to enhance our clothing (and the functions it provides), the environment, and humanity. 

Through my studies within each of these disciplines, I’ve pursued research opportunities that innovate on the capabilities the fields have to offer. I’ve mainly been specialized in lab research for biomaterial textiles and research programs on developing technology integrated clothing. **I actively pursue research within wearable technology, smart textiles, and biofabrication.**

<h2>Current Research: </h2>

<p1>**NCHC Portz Fellowship:** Awarded the 2024-2024 National Collegiate Honors Council Fellowship for my research on Biomaterial and Bioinspired Textiles. The project involves creating biomaterial samples from kitchen waste, such as orange peels, coconut, and dates. I have been experimenting with other additives such as coffee grounds to enhance the durability of the materials, including restricting mold and breakage. Once dried, I test the properties of the specimen, selecting the ones most viable to be scaled up to create garments from. While creating clothing made from nature, I develop research on biological processes that can be used/mimicked to create functional fabrics. The end result will be constructed biomaterial clothing, with implemented and theorized bio-inspired designs researched and developed by myself. My goal is to bridge the gap between fashion and biology, allowing their knowledge and skills to easily be translated and imitated across disciplines.

**VIP Program:** Working within the Biomaterial Based Nanofiber Vertically Integrated Projects Program for over 9 months. My work is focused in Drexel University’s Polymer Lab, where I electrospin the nanofiber, experimenting with different chemical compositions. The project targets filtration and healthcare applications, as the nanofibers can be developed with a variety of antibacterial properties. The team is currently apart of the National Science Foundation’s I-Corp program, supporting the beginning steps of taking the product to market. More information on the lab can be found on our website: [Natural Materials and Polymer Processing Group](https://research.coe.drexel.edu/mse/natural/) 

**Sustainable Fashion Center:** Apart of a student group awarded the Environmental Collaboratory Hub Grant to create a Sustainable Fashion Center at Drexel University. The Center will focus on providing free secondhand clothing to students and hosting events promoting sustainable clothing consumption.

**STAR book:** Wrote an 180 page research report covering sustainable nature and technology driven solutions within the fashion industry. Reviewed and conducted experiments within the topics of smart textiles, wearable technology, biofabrication, regenerative materials, web 3.0, digital fashion, design for disassembly, biomaterial electronics and more. **Read pdf version here:** [If You Wear Clothes Open This Book](https://digitaldesign53.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/starspread.pdf) 

**LED flower dress:** Created a LED embedded dress for my International Baccalaureate Senior Studio Exhibition, displayed in George School theater gallery. **Watch video of the dress:** [Crocus Dress](https://youtu.be/KRtRxaxrXa8)

**CLO3 Designs:** Here are some of the virtual garments I developed using CLO3 during my Costuming the Metaverse class.
