<h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Drexel University's Custom Designed Major allows students to create an interdisciplinary plan of study tailored to a specific focus.
    These focuses are centered around concentrations, specified by the majors students pursue. With the focus of my major being 
    Textile Engineering and Technology, the areas of my concentrations are: Materials Science and Engineering, Textile Design, and 
    User Experience/User Interface. I plan to graduate using technology to enhance our clothing (and the functions it provides), the environment, and humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
    Through my studies within each of these disciplines, I've pursued research opportunities that innovate on the capabilities 
    the fields have to offer. I've mainly been specialized in lab research for biomaterial textiles and research programs on developing 
    technology integrated clothing. I actively pursue research within wearable technology, smart textiles, and biofabrication.
